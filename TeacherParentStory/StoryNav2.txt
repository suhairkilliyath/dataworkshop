Chandran scanned the room for a familiar face and, to his relief, spotted Valsala's dad, Ramesh. He quickly made his way over, "Ramesh! I'm so sorry for being late. The traffic was a nightmare."
Ramesh laughed, "You've missed only the introduction, Chandran. We're just getting into the interesting part."
Curious, Chandran inquired, "What's happening?"
Ramesh, pointing to the digital projector, said, "The school administration is introducing a new digital platform. It's meant to bridge the communication gap between parents and teachers. They want our inputs on the kind of information we'd like to access on this platform."
