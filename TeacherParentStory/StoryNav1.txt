The sun had already set by the time Chandran pulled up to his child's school for the parent-teacher conference. He rushed towards the auditorium, cursing the unexpected traffic that delayed him. As he approached the entrance, he could hear muffled discussions emanating from inside. Taking a deep breath, he slowly opened the door, hoping to slip in unnoticed.
The auditorium was bustling with activity. Parents and teachers were huddled in various groups, engaged in animated discussions. Chandran scanned the room for a familiar face and, to his relief, spotted Valsala's dad, Ramesh. He quickly made his way over, "Ramesh! I'm so sorry for being late. The traffic was a nightmare."
Ramesh laughed, "You've missed only the introduction, Chandran. We're just getting into the interesting part."
